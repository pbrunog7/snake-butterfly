# snake-butterfly
First Python project, created for learning purposes.


## Description
Snake-butterfly is my first project in Python. I used the project developed during this video as a reference for the creation of the classic 
snake game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT2cjrxGpWo&list=PLJ8PYFcmwFOxtJS4EZTGEPxMEo4YdbxdQ


## Status
The current version of the game is a basic snake game. My intention for the final version is as it follows: The caterpillar eats as the the seasons goes by 
(the background will change and an icon will show up, representing the season). At the end, the catterpillar turns into a butterfly.


## Objective
Interact with Python language, some libraries and also develop some GitHub skills.


## How to play
  1. Git clone the repository
  2. Check `requirements.txt` and install the dependencies.
  3. Run `python main.py` to start.
